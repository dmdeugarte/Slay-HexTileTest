# Slay-HexTileTest
Setting this up as a reminder to work on testing on figuring out how to create a HexTile Board using the game Slay as a framework for guidance.

This will be borrowing ideas and Java code from my Minesweeper repository, but will be changing certain aspects to accomodate the differences in shapes for the "buttons" to push
Furthermore, this is merely a test. Further projects will go into relearning to write Perl or some other networking language so as to prepare for a original game idea still in the works.
